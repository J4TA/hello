# hello

I'm a student currently learning mobile development and wanted to get an idea of how github works as I'm sure I'll be using it quite a bit in a few years.  I'm currently studying iOS/Swift and may throw some of my humble and simple projects up here to get ideas from those more experienced and/or intelligent than myself on how to improve some code.

Thanks for reading this and have a great day!
